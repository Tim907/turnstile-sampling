"""
HOW TO:
Min_size, max_size and step_size leads to the grid of different sketch sizes used.
Num_runs defines the number of replications. Quantities for the plots are calculated 
with the median of all replications, so better use uneven numbers.

Below you can change the variance-regularization hyperparameter.
Inside the function utils.run_experiments, different optimizers can be configured from optimizer.py: 
logistic likelihood, variance-regularized logistic likelihood, L1-optimization and SGD
